## Post Payment Response Details   [Skip link to Post Payment Response Details](https://developers.tap.company/reference/charges\#post-payment-response-details)

If the charge request is valid, then Tap will return the charge response which includes the "status" field defining the status of the charge. The possible values are below

`INITIATED, ABANDONED, CANCELLED, FAILED, DECLINED, RESTRICTED, CAPTURED, VOID, TIMEDOUT, UNKNOWN`

`INITIATED` \- Tap will provide the payment URL ( `transaction.url`) to process the payment.

The customer should be redirected to this URL in order to complete the payment.

`CAPTURED` \- Amount was successfully charged.

`ABANDONED, CANCELLED, FAILED, DECLINED, RESTRICTED, VOID, TIMEDOUT, UNKNOWN` \- Payment failed. Use the charge response code and message to identify the reason for failure.

`customer.id`

If you did not provide a customer ID in the charge request, Tap will create a customer ID for each successful transaction and share it within the charge response. You can store this customer ID for future charges, and authorizations, or for getting the list of charges or authorized transactions. You can also create a customer using [Create a Customer](https://developers.tap.company/reference/create-a-customer)

`card.id`

If you requested to save the card in the charge request, Tap will save the card and provide a card ID in the charge response if the transaction is successful. You can save this card ID and use it for future charges or authorizations. However, the card ID cannot be used directly in the charge or authorization request. You must first create a token ID using the saved card's ID and then pass the token ID along with the customer ID in the charge or authorization request.
