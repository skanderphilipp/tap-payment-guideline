This token can serve as a stand-in for a source in the Charges, Authorize, or Card API but it's important to note that these tokens can only be used once within a few minutes of creation. Please be aware that a PCI compliance certificate is required to use this endpoint. For more information, please contact our team. However, you can also create tokens using our Card Web SDK without needing to meet PCI compliance requirements.
