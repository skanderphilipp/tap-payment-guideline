It's important to be aware that these tokens can only be used once, and they can be used in place of a source in the Charges or Authorize API.

To use a saved card in a charge or authorize request API, you must first create a token and then pass the Token ID in the source object.

It's crucial to remember that a Saved Card ID will not be accepted as valid input in a charge or authorization request.
