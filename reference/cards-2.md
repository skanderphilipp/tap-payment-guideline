## Overview   [Skip link to Overview](https://developers.tap.company/reference/cards-2\#overview)

You can save multiple cards under a customer to charge at a later date for quicker checkouts and a seamless payment experience for your customers. Once cards are saved, you can retrieve them for a customer, update or delete them, and use them for future charges. This feature eliminates the need for customers to enter their payment details every time they make a purchase, enhancing their overall shopping experience.

> ## ðŸ“˜  Save Card Feature
>
> To save cards for a `customer.id`, the Save Card feature has to be activated for the Merchant Account. Contact your account manager to enable the Save Card feature.

**Usage of Saved Card**

A saved `card.id`, cannot be directly used in the [Create a Charge](https://developers.tap.company/reference/create-a-charge) or [Create an Authorize](https://developers.tap.company/reference/create-an-authorize) request. First, you need to create the `token.id` for this saved `card.id`, and then use this `token.id` to initiate a transaction.

## Card Request Example   [Skip link to Card Request Example](https://developers.tap.company/reference/cards-2\#card-request-example)

The Token ID and Customer ID are both required to successfully save a card.

You can use our JS library to create the token without being PCI compliant.
