<meta name="referrer" content="origin-when-crossorigin">

```

## Create the Payment Form   [Skip link to Create the Payment Form](https://developers.tap.company/docs/card-sdk-web-v1\#create-the-payment-form)

To securely collect card details from your customers, Elements creates UI components for you that are hosted by Tap payments. They are then placed into your payment form, rather than you creating them directly. To determine where to insert these components, create empty DOM elements (containers) with unique IDs within your payment form.

HTML

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

<form id="form-container" method="post" action="/charge">
  <!-- Tap element will be here -->
  <div id="element-container"></div>
  <div id="error-handler" role="alert"></div>
  <div id="success" style=" display: none;;position: relative;float: left;">
        Success! Your token is <span id="token"></span>
  </div>
  <!-- Tap pay button -->
  <button id="tap-btn">Submit</button>
</form>

```

## Style the Payment Form   [Skip link to Style the Payment Form](https://developers.tap.company/docs/card-sdk-web-v1\#style-the-payment-form)

To style the payment form and also the submit button, you need to add some CSS into your code. It is worth noting that the styling of the form is up to you, and below is an example to start with.

CSS

## Load the Library using JavaScript   [Skip link to Load the Library using JavaScript](https://developers.tap.company/docs/card-sdk-web-v1\#load-the-library-using-javascript)

To effectively utilize the Card JS library, begin by creating an instance of an Element in JavaScript once your form is loaded. This instance should be mounted onto the Element container you've previously set up. The main action of this process is the use of a public key provided by Tap, which grants access to the JS library and links it to your specific TAP account. Ensure you pass this public key as a parameter when calling `Tapjsli()`.

Once you pass your account's public key in the `Tapjsli()`, and the payment form loads, it will show you to the left all the card payments logos that are enabled on your account. Add the below JavaScript code to complete this step.

JavaScript

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

//pass your public key from tap's dashboard
var tap = Tapjsli('pk_test_EtHFV4BuPQokJT6jiROls87Y');

var elements = tap.elements({});

var style = {
  base: {
    color: '#535353',
    lineHeight: '18px',
    fontFamily: 'sans-serif',
    fontSmoothing: 'antialiased',
    fontSize: '16px',
    '::placeholder': {
      color: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.26)',
      fontSize:'15px'
    }
  },
  invalid: {
    color: 'red'
  }
};
// input labels/placeholders
var labels = {
    cardNumber:"Card Number",
    expirationDate:"MM/YY",
    cvv:"CVV",
    cardHolder:"Card Holder Name"
  };
//payment options
var paymentOptions = {
  currencyCode:["KWD","USD","SAR"], //change the currency array as per your requirement
  labels : labels,
  TextDirection:'ltr', //only two values valid (rtl, ltr)
  paymentAllowed: ['VISA', 'MASTERCARD', 'AMERICAN_EXPRESS', 'MADA'] //default string 'all' to show all payment methods enabled on your account
}
//create element, pass style and payment options
var card = elements.create('card', {style: style},paymentOptions);
//mount element
card.mount('#element-container');
//card change event listener
card.addEventListener('change', function(event) {
  if(event.loaded){ //If â€˜trueâ€™, js library is loaded
    console.log("UI loaded :"+event.loaded);
    console.log("current currency is :"+card.getCurrency())
  }
  var displayError = document.getElementById('error-handler');
  if (event.error) {
    displayError.textContent = event.error.message;
  } else {
    displayError.textContent = '';
  }
});

```

### Get Card BIN Details   [Skip link to Get Card BIN Details](https://developers.tap.company/docs/card-sdk-web-v1\#get-card-bin-details)

The first six digits of a credit or debit card number are known as the "Bank Identification Number (BIN)," which are essential for identifying the card's issuing bank and other related details. The TAP JS Card library is equipped to retrieve this BIN information in real-time. To leverage this feature in your application, ensure that your code includes the below specific condition that should be added in the code that was shared in the previous step in `card.addEventListener() ` as below, that triggers the retrieval of BIN details.

The condition stating if(event.BIN) {} shown in the JavaScript tab will display in the console of your website the card details related to the BIN added in the card form as shown in tab BIN Result.

JavaScriptBIN Result

```rdmd-code lang-groovy theme-light

card.addEventListener('change', function(event) {
  if(event.BIN){
    console.log(event.BIN)
  }
  var displayError = document.getElementById('card-errors');
  if (event.error) {
    displayError.textContent = event.error.message;
  } else {
    displayError.textContent = '';
  }
});

```

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

{
   "bin":"424242",
   "bank":"",
   "card_brand":"VISA",
   "card_type":"CREDIT",
   "card_category":"",
   "card_scheme":"VISA",
   "country_name":"UNITED KINGDOM",
   "country":"GB",
   "website":"",
   "phone":"",
   "address_required":false,
   "api_version":"V2"
}

```

## Tokenize the Card Details   [Skip link to Tokenize the Card Details](https://developers.tap.company/docs/card-sdk-web-v1\#tokenize-the-card-details)

Transforming the payment details collected through Elements into a token is an essential step in the process. To accomplish this, set up an event handler that manages the submit event on the form. This handler is responsible for transmitting the fields to TAP for tokenization and strategically prevents the form's default submission. The form submission is done through JavaScript in the subsequent step, ensuring a controlled and secure process of token generation for your payment transactions.

As you can see in the below step, the function `tap.createToken()` provides a Promise, offering a straightforward outcome:

1. **result.id**: Successful creation of a Token.
2. **result.error**: An indication of an error, including any client-side validation issues.

JavaScript

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

// Handle form submission
var form = document.getElementById('form-container');
form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  tap.createToken(card).then(function(result) {
    console.log(result);
    if (result.error) {
      // Inform the user if there was an error
      var errorElement = document.getElementById('error-handler');
      errorElement.textContent = result.error.message;
    } else {
      // Send the token to your server
      var errorElement = document.getElementById('success');
      errorElement.style.display = "block";
      var tokenElement = document.getElementById('token');
      tokenElement.textContent = result.id;
    tapTokenHandler(token)

    }
  });
});

```

## Submit the Token to your Server   [Skip link to Submit the Token to your Server](https://developers.tap.company/docs/card-sdk-web-v1\#submit-the-token-to-your-server)

To conclude the integration of the Card JS library, the last step is to submit the generated token, along with any additional collected information, to your server. In the previous step, you can see in the code the function `tapTokenHandler()` has been called to handle the submission of the token, and below is the code used to complete this functionalitiy.

JavaScript

```rdmd-code lang-less theme-light

function tapTokenHandler(token) {
  // Insert the token ID into the form so it gets submitted to the server
  var form = document.getElementById('payment-form');
  var hiddenInput = document.createElement('input');
  hiddenInput.setAttribute('type', 'hidden');
  hiddenInput.setAttribute('name', 'tapToken');
  hiddenInput.setAttribute('value', token.id);
  form.appendChild(hiddenInput);

  // Submit the form
  form.submit();
}

```
