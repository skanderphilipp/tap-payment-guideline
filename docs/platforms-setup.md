This document provides an overview of the various setups and integration flows related to platforms within Tap. The primary goal is to simplify integration for platforms looking to onboard with us, ensuring a unified and efficient process. We have expanded our platform categorization into four distinct sub-platforms:

1. Commerce Platform
2. Billing Platform
3. Retail Platform
4. App Platform

Each of these serves a specific purpose, and we will define them in detail below.

## Commerce Platform   [Skip link to Commerce Platform](https://developers.tap.company/docs/platforms-setup\#commerce-platform)

Commerce platforms are designed for online transactions, excluding face-to-face or invoice-based transactions. Merchants providing online commerce services fall under this category.

_**Example**_: Shopify is an example of a commerce platform.

## Billing Platform   [Skip link to Billing Platform](https://developers.tap.company/docs/platforms-setup\#billing-platform)

Billing platforms handle transactions based on invoices and related payments. Merchants that primarily deal with invoices and payment based on invoices belong to this category.

_**Example**_: If Shopify offers invoicing services in addition to online transactions, they would be categorized as a billing platform.

## Retail Platform   [Skip link to Retail Platform](https://developers.tap.company/docs/platforms-setup\#retail-platform)

Retail platforms are intended for face-to-face transactions, conducted digitally in the same location as the customer. Merchants offering in-person digital transactions fall under this category.

**_Example_**: Restaurants or dining establishments that accept digital payments at the table are retail platforms.

## App Platform   [Skip link to App Platform](https://developers.tap.company/docs/platforms-setup\#app-platform)

App platforms provide white-labeled applications to clients, typically pre-built and rebranded.

Integration: These platforms focus on app development and white-labeling apps for clients.

In the world of digital transactions, Payment Service Providers (PSPs) play a crucial role in making payments smooth and secure. These organizations act as intermediaries between businesses and financial institutions, ensuring that funds move seamlessly from customers to merchants. PSPs offer a range of services, but they can be categorized into distinct sub-segments that serve various functions within the payment ecosystem.

Let's break down the key sub-segments within the realm of PSPs:

## Payment Technology   [Skip link to Payment Technology](https://developers.tap.company/docs/platforms-setup\#payment-technology)

## Payment Facilitator   [Skip link to Payment Facilitator](https://developers.tap.company/docs/platforms-setup\#payment-facilitator)

A specialized PSP managing payments for multiple sub-merchants. They simplify onboarding and payment processing, often handling compliance and regulatory tasks.
